        <h1>Literature and Stories</h1>

        <h2>The Odyssey</h2>
        <p>Odysseus avoided the wrath of the Sirens on his way back to Ithaca after a warning from Circe.
            He clogged his crew members' ears with wax as they sailed past, and had himself tied to the mast of the ship so that he could hear
            their song without being able to steer the ship towards their doom.
        </p>

        <h2>Orpheus</h2>
        <p>Orpheus, a poet, was on a ship with the Argonauts that was about to pass the Sirens' domain. When Orpheus could hear their voices he
            began to play a song on his lyre so loudly that it drowned out the Sirens' song. All but one member of the crew evaded the Sirens
            and remained on board. One man could not resist the small bit of their song that was heard before Orpheus began playing, and
            jumped overboard and attempted to swim to the Sirens. He was rescues by Aphrodite, who later birthed their son Eryx.
        </p>

        <h2>Sirens vs The Muses</h2>
        <p>In one mythos, Hera convinced the Sirens to challenge the Muses to a singing contest. They lost to the Muses, who plucked their feathers
            to make themselves crowns as punishment.
