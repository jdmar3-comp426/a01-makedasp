        <h1>Mythology</h1>

        <p>According to popular mythology, the half bird, half woman creatures are the daughters of river god Achelous and one of the Muses, either Terpsichore, Melpomene, or Calliope.
            Like all mythology, there are different accounts and versions of who the Sirens parents were and stories about them.

            According to Homer there existed two Sirens, but in later literature this was often increased to three who resided off the coast of Italy.
            In the Odyssey, Homer did not describe the Sirens, but it was assumed that they were at the very least humanlike, and probably feminine, creatures.
            Later authors and artists began to portray them as the Sirens' we see depicted today. This portrayl was influenced by the harpy, another bird-human hybrid in
            Greek mythology that personifies storm winds.

            The Sirens' home was a series of three rocky islands called Sirenum scopuli. The piles of bones and the rotting flesh of their victims littered the area. Some mythology states 
            that if a human were to hear the Sirens' song and live, the Sirens, distraught, would hurl themselves into the sea and drown.
